# HandsOn

This project is a human-computer interface that can understand some basic commands given by the user by analyzing with hand gestures with a camera.
Image processing techniques are used to extract the hand from the background, then to try and extract useful information from it by tracking the tip of the fingers. The extracted information could be the number of the raised fingers or the coordinates of a pointing finger.
